# Unit3_SecondMiniProject  Requirements as interpreted by me:
1.  Inspect the dataset provided by insructor.
2.  Determine what I want to investigate within this data.
3.  Decided to hone in on patients who had a Medical Specialty of OB/Gyn.
4.  Wanted to view the impact of Race and Diabetes Medication on Length of Hospital Stay in the Main Cohort and Ob/Gyn Cohort.
